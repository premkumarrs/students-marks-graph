# Student Marks Bar Graph Visualizer

This Python program allows you to input marks for multiple students across multiple subjects and visualizes their overall performance as a minimalist bar graph using Tkinter.

## Features

- Enter any number of students and subjects.
- For each subject, specify the total marks and marks obtained.
- Calculates each student’s total marks, maximum possible marks, and percentage.
- Displays a clean, pastel-colored bar graph with each student’s percentage and their total/maximum marks.
- Minimalist, modern, and easy to use.

## How to Use

1. Run the script:
    ```
    python "# Simple program to collect students' na.py"
    ```
2. For each student:
    - Enter the student’s name.
    - Enter the number of subjects.
    - For each subject, enter the total marks and marks obtained.
3. When finished, type `done` as the student name.
4. A window will appear showing the bar graph.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x (no external libraries needed, uses built-in Tkinter)

## Example

```
Enter student name (or type 'done' to finish): Alice
How many subjects for Alice?: 3
Enter total marks for subject 1: 100
Enter marks obtained for subject 1: 90
Enter total marks for subject 2: 100
Enter marks obtained for subject 2: 85
Enter total marks for subject 3: 100
Enter marks obtained for subject 3: 95
Enter student name (or type 'done' to finish): done
```

A bar graph will be displayed with Alice’s percentage and total marks.
